# Testing

## Pre-validation code review

After implementing a feature or code/configuration change, and before the final
quality-command pass:

1. Use `ponytail:ponytail-review` to review the complete task diff and connected
   callers and tests against the task's acceptance criteria and repository rules.
2. Trace affected security boundaries: input validation, authentication,
   authorization and tenant isolation, injection risks, and secret or sensitive
   data exposure. Check transaction safety, error handling, regressions, and
   missing tests where relevant.
3. Fix all must-fix findings and recheck the fixes before running the final
   quality commands. Record the review scope, findings and their disposition, and
   any remaining limitations in the handoff; explicitly state when no findings
   were found.
4. Run the required quality commands below and task-specific acceptance checks.
   If a validation fix changes code, review the changed paths again before
   rerunning the affected checks.

Keep tests and focused checks running during development, including test-first
work. This review complements the dependency audit and GitHub PR review. It is
an agent workflow requirement; CI continues to run the existing automated checks.

## Quality commands

- **Node.js:** 24.x (the current local baseline is 24.20.0).
- Install locked dependencies with `npm ci`.
- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build`.
- CI runs those same commands on every push and pull request.
- A separate CI job starts disposable PostgreSQL 16, applies committed migrations
  twice, and runs the onboarding/authorization, staff, catalogue, and product integration suites with
  `AFCS_TEST_DATABASE_URL`. It uses fixed, job-local credentials and no live services.
- CI also runs `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` after installation. Run it
  locally for dependency or CI changes and before deployment.

## Strategy

- Vitest is the unit-test runner. `npm run test` uses `vitest run` for a
  non-interactive one-shot run and fails if no test files are discovered.
- Configuration and authentication tests cover missing/malformed keys, origin
  validation, sanitized session lookup, guard denial/acceptance, all six protected
  pages, and the sign-in page. Auth unit tests mock Clerk; they do not establish
  real credential delivery, session revocation, or production-cookie behavior.
- `vitest.config.mts` resolves the same `@/` source alias used by application code.
- Database unit tests cover URL validation, lazy pool creation, development reload
  reuse, and sanitized background errors without connecting to PostgreSQL. Task 07
  separately verifies its baseline migration on a fresh local database and then
  development. The separate CI database job now verifies committed migrations
  against a fresh disposable service; the `quality` job stays database-free.
- Later tasks add focused tests for tenancy, authorization, exact totals, status
  transitions, inventory, and payments as those behaviors are introduced.
- Task 08 tests mock Clerk and the PostgreSQL transport while using Drizzle's real
  query generation. They cover exact organization/user filtering, absent/deleted
  or mismatched membership, stale claims, sanitized failures, the parameterized
  local mapping read, and rechecking after removal or organization change. Local
  acceptance separately applies/reapplies reviewed SQL and checks defaults and
  constraints in a rolled-back transaction on the isolated verification database.
- Task 09 unit tests cover validated creator-only bootstrap, remote recovery,
  current membership denial, safe correlation, preserved framework redirects, and
  onboarding routing. Eight opt-in PostgreSQL tests cover actual concurrent
  reservation/completion, pinned IDs, uniqueness, tenant-scoped reads, rollback,
  and non-overwrite behavior. Follow the
  [isolated command](database.md#onboarding-persistence-and-verification). Local
  default runs and CI's `quality` job skip these tests without
  `AFCS_TEST_DATABASE_URL`; the CI `database` job explicitly supplies it.
- Task 09's manual development browser smoke covers real sign-in/onboarding,
  validation and retained values, activation after persistence, idempotent resume,
  mobile RTL layout, membership-removal denial, and sign-out. It adds no E2E
  framework or CI browser suite; those retain Task 33's scope.
- Task 10 adds permission-default tests, current tenant/role guard tests with
  parameterized real Drizzle queries, and per-page permission checks. The isolated
  PostgreSQL suite now has fifteen tests: it also verifies explicit legacy setup resume, one-time owner
  bootstrap, concurrent membership claims, rollback, non-restoration after role
  deletion/downgrade/rejoin, constraints, and actual grant query isolation. The
  guard preserves sign-in/framework exceptions and sanitizes service failures.
- Browser end-to-end coverage is deferred to Task 33; it must use isolated seeded
  data for purchasing, accepted receipt/payable creation, supplier payment, and
  stock/supplier balance reconciliation rather than a shared development database.

## Staff management verification

Task 11 adds staff provider/action/UI tests plus unit tests using Drizzle's real
SQL generation. They cover owner-only changes, the last active owner, actor
rechecking, tenant and identity isolation, input validation, retry behavior,
safe errors, pending controls, and staff entry without a business grant.
Six additional opt-in PostgreSQL tests verify actual row-lock concurrency and
revocation against synthetic Clerk memberships. Run them with onboarding's
isolated command and `src/db/staff.integration.test.ts`; no live provider mutation
is needed. Static rendering verifies markup and feedback, not browser interaction
or email/OTP delivery.

## Domain primitive verification

Task 12's colocated `src/domain/*.test.ts` tests run with
`npm run test -- src/domain`, without a database or provider. They verify exact
decimal parsing/output, signed half-up ties, large values, precision and size
rejection, gram-precise custom/local measures, differing quantity/price measures,
rounded-line sums, cumulative receipt reconciliation, both cash exchange directions,
whole cash, the lifetime reduction cap, UUIDs, UTC timestamps, and explicit status
transitions. Expected monetary examples come from ADR 0019. These tests establish
pure calculations; later service tests must establish authorization, durable
snapshots, concurrent/idempotent posting, and reconciliation against stored rows.

## Catalogue verification

Task 13's service/action/static-render tests check input validation, tenant-bound
SQL, permission denial, actor changes while waiting for a lock, safe errors,
pending controls, retained values, and read-only management screens. Its opt-in
`src/db/catalog.integration.test.ts` suite checks every role, tenant isolation,
case-insensitive uniqueness, deactivation, custom measures, fractional weights,
10/11-maan bags, returned snapshots, actual database constraints, concurrent
seeding, and a queued actor's revoked grant. It uses the same isolated database
guard/cleanup as the other integration suites, and CI's database job includes it.
Static rendering does not establish live browser interaction or translation quality.

Task 14 adds product service/action/static-render tests and
`src/db/products.integration.test.ts` to the existing isolated CI job. Coverage
includes validation, authenticated tenant-derived authority, all roles, same-tenant
unit/category references (also enforced by database constraints), active reference
selection, case-insensitive product names and optional codes, concurrent duplicate
creation, failed-edit rollback, inactive record retention, and queued actor
revocation. UI checks cover list/detail/edit, read-only access, setup/empty states,
labels, retained values, inactive selections, pending state, and safe feedback.
These are separate from real browser, Clerk, and translation smoke evidence.

## Workspace UX verification

The UX audit fixes add session-aware home tests, seven-role navigation and
dashboard/settings checks, locale-aware Select tests, error retry wiring, and
confirmation cancellation/submission coverage. `src/db/workspace.test.ts` checks
the metadata read's verified organization/membership/user parameters and safe
denial/error behavior. The existing opt-in onboarding suite also checks business
identity/role switching and denial after revocation against isolated PostgreSQL;
all four database suites now contain 50 tests.

Local synthetic HTML/browser fixtures are kept under ignored `artifacts/`.
They exercise layout and native control behavior without contacting a provider or
application database. Their evidence does not establish real Clerk login,
translated terminology, deployed routes, or provider-backed mutations. No browser
test dependency or CI browser suite is added.

## Dependency gate

- The audit checks production dependencies and fails for high or critical
  advisories. Lower-severity findings remain visible for review.
- Update compatible affected packages and commit the lockfile; keep Next.js and
  `eslint-config-next` on the same version. Run all four quality commands after
  dependency changes.
- There are no advisory exceptions. If a fix is unavailable, obtain owner approval
  and record the advisory ID, affected path/reachability, mitigation, owner, and
  expiry/review date in `docs/security.md` before changing the gate. A failed audit
  remains a release blocker until fixed or an approved, narrowly scoped exception
  is implemented; never bypass it with `continue-on-error` or a broad severity change.

## Scope

- No browser DOM test environment, coverage tooling, or end-to-end framework is
  part of this baseline. PostgreSQL integration tests use only the dedicated local
  verification database or CI's disposable service, never a shared application DB.
- CI uses explicitly nonfunctional Clerk key placeholders only for compilation.
  They cannot sign in users and must not be reused for an application deployment.
  Unit tests use their own isolated placeholders and never contact Clerk.
- A normal local build requires development keys in `.env.local`. Follow the
  [authentication smoke check](deployment.md#authentication-setup-and-smoke-check)
  to verify real sign-in and sign-out; this remains separate from unit tests.
