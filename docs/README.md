## Documentation rules

- Update a decision record before implementing a choice that changes product
  policy, data modelling, authentication, authorization, or deployment.
- Check the [build plan's gate status and pilot delivery order](agent-sized-build-plan.md#current-gate-status)
  before selecting a task. Accepted ADRs govern policy; update affected plan tasks
  when an approved policy changes.
- Do not present a proposal or assumption as a confirmed fact.
- Keep task handoffs concise: completed checks, changed files, migration and
  environment impact, known limitations, and the exact next task.
