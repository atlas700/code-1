# Security

## Confirmed requirements

- Tenant isolation is enforced server-side from authenticated organization membership.
- Hiding a UI control is not authorization; protected queries and mutations require
  server-side permission checks.
- Untrusted server input requires validation.
- Secrets must not be exposed through `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables or committed to the
  repository.
- User-facing errors must not expose stack traces, SQL, secrets, or personal data.

## Decision status

**Decided — G4 authentication:** Clerk is the approved managed identity and secure
session provider for Task 06; see [ADR 0002](adr/0002-clerk-authentication.md). The
enabled sign-in method remains a pilot-validation decision. Under
[ADR 0014](adr/0014-clerk-organizations-local-business-roles.md), Clerk owns
membership and the application will own business permissions. Neither a
client-controlled organization ID nor Clerk Admin/Member roles grant business access.

Task 06 uses Clerk's SDK-managed sessions, per-page server guards, and an explicit
`authorizedParties` origin. Authentication returns an external user identity only;
the separate Task 08 adapter verifies current active-organization membership against
Clerk's Backend API before resolving a local organization UUID. Missing/deleted or
mismatched membership and absent local mappings deny tenant access; outages throw
sanitized errors without exposing provider details, SQL, or credentials. Membership
is rechecked on every lookup, not cached across requests or mirrored by webhooks.
`requirePermission()` now checks the fixed ADR 0016 matrix and the exact local
organization/membership/user assignment on every call. Existing pages use it;
future data operations and mutations must call it themselves. Denials return the
framework's missing-resource response; outages throw sanitized errors. No role is
inferred from Clerk Admin/Member, and unknown roles/permissions deny access.
Task 09 validates its authenticated bootstrap action with Zod, verifies remote
creator identity and current membership, and provisions only that creator's saved
request. Client tenant/role IDs and previous action state never grant authority.
Creation retries use one durable request and a unique Clerk slug; recovery does
not restore removed memberships. Under ADR 0016, successful provisioning also
records the initial owner membership and its local grant atomically, once. The
durable marker prevents retries from restoring a changed/deleted grant or giving
it to a rejoined membership. Only confirmed
local provisioning exposes the activation control. Failure diagnostics contain
operation, stage, and correlation UUID, without raw inputs, errors, SQL, or PII.
The Clerk publishable
key may use `NEXT_PUBLIC_`; its secret key must never do so. Missing or malformed
configuration fails without echoing credential values.

**Decided — G4 role matrix:** the founder approved
[ADR 0016](adr/0016-local-business-authorization.md) on 27 October: seven fixed local
roles, an explicit action matrix, membership-bound assignments, one-time owner
bootstrap, and a server-only guard. Task 10 implements this policy; G1 and the
remaining operational gates stay open.

[ADR 0019](adr/0019-pilot-numeric-settlement-policy.md) approves a future fixed
`supplier_payments.adjust_rounding` permission for owner only. Task 25 must enforce
the lifetime 0.99 debt-currency cap atomically, retaining actor/reason/provenance.
Current code does not yet implement that permission. Custom weight management
and payment/rate entry reuse existing `catalog.manage` and
`supplier_payments.record`; neither permits debt reductions.

**Partially resolved — G4 operational security:** the founder owns operations and
backup recovery under [ADR 0018](adr/0018-managed-pilot-hosting.md). Approve access,
logging, retention, and incident procedures with the remaining deployment plan;
verify a non-production restore before pilot use.

## Staff management

Task 11 enforces staff permissions in the server operation, including a fresh
membership/local-role check after acquiring the organization row lock. Admins
cannot grant, demote, or remove owners. Only current, exactly matched memberships
count toward the last-active-owner invariant; remote removal denies stale-session
access and rejoining requires an explicit new grant. Bootstrap markers are never
reset. Invitations and manual additions create no business grants. Invitation
URLs/metadata are excluded from staff list responses and diagnostics.

The lock serializes application staff operations across server processes; Clerk
does not participate in a PostgreSQL transaction. Direct Clerk Dashboard edits,
self-service departures, and provider-side account deletion can bypass the app's
last-owner check. Use the app for ownership changes; reconcile external changes
without resetting grants or bootstrap markers. No automated owner recovery or
Clerk Admin promotion is introduced. See [Task 11 recovery](handoffs/11-staff-management.md#expiry-and-recovery).

## Deferred controls

The first mutation must meet the safe error and correlation requirements in the
[mutation contract](api-conventions.md#mutation-contract), approved by
[ADR 0015](adr/0015-server-action-mutation-boundary.md). General request logging,
rate limiting, and formal audit logging retain their later build-plan scope.

## Dependency advisories

Production dependencies must pass the high/critical audit gate described in
[Testing](testing.md#dependency-gate) before deployment. There are currently no
approved advisory exceptions. Record any future owner-approved exception here with
its advisory ID, affected path/reachability, mitigation, owner, and expiry/review date.

### Development-tooling advisory tracked on 20 October 2026

[GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm)
affects `braces` through 3.0.3; the advisory lists no patched release. The installed
path is `eslint-config-next → @next/eslint-plugin-next → fast-glob → micromatch →
braces`. The full audit reports five high entries for this one development-only
dependency chain; `npm ls braces --omit=dev` confirms it is absent from the
production dependency tree.

The failure case is a deeply nested, attacker-controlled brace pattern exhausting
the parser's call stack. The current lint command uses the fixed `src` path;
application requests do not supply patterns to this tooling. Keep lint patterns
repository-controlled and review untrusted lint configuration before execution.
The repository owner must recheck this advisory on the next dependency update or
before accepting externally supplied patterns. Track a compatible upstream fix;
the audit's suggested downgrade to `eslint-config-next` 14 is incompatible with
this project's Next.js 16 lint stack. This is tracked development-tooling exposure,
not an exception to the production audit gate.

### Development-tooling audit update — 25 October 2026

Task 07's production audit reports zero vulnerabilities. The full audit now
reports four moderate entries from
`drizzle-kit → @esbuild-kit/esm-loader → @esbuild-kit/core-utils → esbuild`
([GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)).
The affected esbuild version is 0.18.20; the advisory concerns its development
HTTP server. This project uses Drizzle Kit only for local generation/migration,
not an esbuild HTTP server or exposed Drizzle Studio. It is absent from production
dependencies. Recheck on the next tooling update; the audit's proposed Drizzle Kit
0.18.1 downgrade would replace the current migration tooling and is not applied.

The existing ESLint dependency's Zod was updated from 4.6.5 to 4.6.7 to resolve
[GHSA-mrhx-c7xc-m3w5](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mrhx-c7xc-m3w5).
No high/critical entries remain in the full audit. The older `braces` entry above
is a historical report; the current audit does not report it. The production gate
and its no-exceptions policy are unchanged.
